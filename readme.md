There was compared two types of finding the smallest number of coins to get needed amount of money: greedy algorithm and dynamic programming algorithm. In the result, experiment with small amount of money shows that dynamic programming algorithm is more accurate and faster. But, experiment with large amount of money shows that greedy algorithm is much more faster (even in millions of times) than dynamic programming algorithm, but in some cases can return not the best decision. In other words, dynamic programming algorithm in large amount of money is slower but return the best decision, that is because of counting every possible combination.
So, it can be concluded that the fastest algorithm in big data is greedy algorithm, while the most accurate is dynamic programming algorithm.
